# Sticker pack manager
This is a python project meant to make organizing telegram stickers much easier.
It allows to save sticker packs sent to a bot, then, with a web UI, you can delete them and
create custom sticker packs out of them.

## TO-DO List:
- Remove page limits (add query paging to all pages)
- Add sticker pack thumbnails to easily show what is inside (2x2 square of stickers)
- Add a delete button to sticker packs
- Implement signal sticker pack uploads
- Improve export to json (maybe exporting everything within a zip?)
  - Make it work properly with both individual packs, custom ones and entire database
